### Introduction
Hey and welcome to my blog ðŸ‘‹

Here I talk about all sorts of things that are currently on my mind.
Usually it's about os/kernel development or something of the likes.

### About me
My name is Tim and I am 18 years young, and I go by the name of `V01D-NULL` or more commonly `V01D` online.
I am half american, half german and speak both languages fluently.

My favorite programming languages are C and assembly, currently I am looking for a 
scripting language to learn as I believe every programmer should know a cross platform scripting lanauge (even if it's just a little)

I _love_ learning new things,which lead me to try many things from building a frontend website, and learning about cybersecurity to building kernels which is what I ultimately fell in love with.

When I'm not programming I'm probably out doing freerunning (a branch of parkour which involves fluid and aesthetic movement rather than speed and efficiency) or simply being your average supernatural highschool senior ðŸ˜›

### Technical skills
At the time of writing I have been doing osdev for about 6,7,8 months or so and although I have much to learn, I have picked up some very valuable knowledge through others which is why I created this blog in the first place.

All in all I started programming at the age of 16 Â½ and after trying many languages for a solid year I ultimately found and started to aquire C and assembly skills.
